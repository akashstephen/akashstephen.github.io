      <title>Growing plants in Lunar soil!</title>

      <description>Scientists at NASA grew Arabidopsis (which is the most studied plant of all time) in Lunar Soil!!! Samples of lunar soil were brought back by the Apollo Missions (11,12,and 17). They say that the plants sprouted in just two days!
Interestingly there were differences in the growth among the different samples. Most notably the Apollo 11 mission samples were under a lot of stress (but still managed to sprout!).

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;</description>

      <title>Life found on a 830 million year old rock?</title>

      <description>I just saw this video about finding life embedded inside rock salt in Australia thats 830 million years old. Crazy stuff. Apparently the water and the minerals kept these prokaryotes in a habitable ecosystem. We dont really know if they are alive tho, but it is fascinating to realise that life existed in such salty and harsh environments. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the day we find live on another planet.
