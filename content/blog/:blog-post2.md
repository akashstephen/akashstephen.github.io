I just saw this video about finding life embedded inside rock salt in Australia thats 830 million years old. Crazy stuff. Apparently the water and the minerals kept these prokaryotes in a habitable ecosystem. We dont really know if they are alive tho, but it is fascinating to realise that life existed in such salty and harsh environments. Can't wait for the day we find live on another planet.
