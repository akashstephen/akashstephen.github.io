Scientists at NASA grew Arabidopsis (which is the most studied plant of all time) in Lunar Soil!!! Samples of lunar soil were brought back by the Apollo Missions (11,12,and 17). They say that the plants sprouted in just two days! 

Interestingly there were differences in the growth among the different samples. Most notably the Apollo 11 mission samples were under a lot of stress (but still managed to sprout!).
